LLJS
====

LLJS (formerly known as *JS) is a typed dialect of JavaScript that offers a C-like type system with manual memory management.
It compiles to JavaScript and lets you write memory-efficient and GC pause-free code less painfully, in short, LLJS is the bastard child of JavaScript and C.
LLJS is early research prototype work, so don't expect anything rock solid just yet.
The research goal here is to explore low-level statically typed features in a high-level dynamically typed language.
Think of it as inline assembly in C, or the unsafe keyword in C#.
It's not pretty, but it gets the job done.
